# Project-Leonhard
This repository contains my solutions to the first 100 problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), implemented using both Python (Jupyter notebooks) and Mathematica (real notebooks). I found it instructive to solve the problems and recommend it to anyone looking to transition from language to the other.

Note that the intention here is primarily to share the methods which worked well for each problem in each language, rather than simply to provide the answers. I believe this goal is consistent with Project Euler's stated policy regarding the first 100 problem (per the Q+A on their main page):

> However, the rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler does not apply to the first one-hundred problems, as long as any discussion clearly aims to instruct methods, not just provide answers, and does not directly threaten to undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems. Problems 1 to 100 provide a wealth of helpful introductory teaching material and if you are able to respect our requirements, then we give permission for those problems and their solutions to be discussed elsewhere.


The Mathematica code should run out-of-the-box in version 11.3 or higher. The only exception to this are the `Import` calls involving local file paths for the problems with data files; to run these on a different machine the data files need to be saved and the correct file path added (Insert > File Path...).
