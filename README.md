# Project-Leonhard
Solutions to problems from a certain well-known computational problem archive..

The Mathematica code in these notebooks should run out-of-the-box in version 11.3 or higher. The only exception to this are the `Import` calls involving local file paths for the problems with data files; to run these on a different machine the data files need to be saved and the correct file path added (Insert > File Path...).
